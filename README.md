## üéØ Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive, production-ready implementation of PLS-DA specifically designed for MS/MS (Mass Spectrometry) IDA (Information Dependent Acquisition) data analysis. Perfect for metabolomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery workflows.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Complete PLS-DA implementation** using NIPALS algorithm
- ‚úÖ **Zero dependencies** - uses only base R
- ‚úÖ **Cross-validation** for optimal model selection
- ‚úÖ **Variable Importance (VIP)** scores for biomarker discovery
- ‚úÖ **7 publication-ready visualizations**
- ‚úÖ **4 detailed CSV exports** for further analysis
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive documentation** with examples
- ‚úÖ **Example dataset included** for immediate testing

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/PLSDA-MSMS-Analysis.git
cd PLSDA-MSMS-Analysis
```

### Run the Example

```r
# In R console
source("plsda_analysis.R")

# Or from command line
Rscript plsda_analysis.R
```

**That's it!** The script will:
1. Generate example MS/MS data (150 samples, 50 features, 3 classes)
2. Perform PLS-DA analysis with cross-validation
3. Create 7 plots and 4 data files
4. Display comprehensive results summary

‚è±Ô∏è **Runtime:** ~5-10 seconds for example data

---

## üìä Example Output

The analysis automatically generates:

### Visualizations (PNG)
1. **Scores Plot** - Sample clustering and group separation
2. **Test Predictions** - Model validation on held-out data
3. **VIP Scores** - Top 20 most important features
4. **Loadings Plot** - Feature contribution to separation
5. **CV Results** - Model optimization curve
6. **Confusion Matrix** - Classification performance heatmap
7. **Variance Explained** - Component importance

### Data Files (CSV)
1. **Predictions** - Sample classifications with scores
2. **VIP Scores** - All features ranked by importance
3. **Model Summary** - Performance metrics (accuracy, R¬≤X, R¬≤Y)
4. **Loadings** - Feature contributions to each component

## üí° Why This Implementation?

### Advantages of PLS-DA for MS/MS Data

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Handles high dimensionality** | Works with 1000s of m/z features |
| **Manages multicollinearity** | Correlated features (common in MS data) |
| **Supervised classification** | Uses group labels for maximum separation |
| **Interpretable results** | VIP scores, loadings, and scores plots |
| **Robust to noise** | Dimensionality reduction filters noise |
| **No external dependencies** | Pure R implementation |

### Why Not Just Use PCA?

- **PCA** is unsupervised (ignores group labels)
- **PLS-DA** maximizes separation between known groups
- **PLS-DA** provides biomarker rankings (VIP scores)
- **PLS-DA** is designed for classification tasks

---

## üìã Requirements

- **R** version ‚â• 4.0.0
- **No additional packages required!**
- **Memory:** Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- **Storage:** ~10MB for outputs

---

## üéì Methodology

This implementation uses:
- **NIPALS algorithm** for PLS component extraction
- **Stratified train-test split** (70-30 default)
- **K-fold cross-validation** for component optimization
- **VIP scores** for feature importance ranking
- **Dummy matrix encoding** for multi-class problems

See [README_FULL.md](README_FULL.md) Section 13 for complete statistical background.

## üìù Using Your Own Data

Your CSV should have this structure:

```csv
SampleID,Class,Batch,mz_200.00,mz_250.00,mz_300.00,...
S001,Control,1,1234.5,2345.6,3456.7,...
S002,Treatment,1,5678.9,6789.0,7890.1,...
```

See [README_FULL.md](README_FULL.md) Section 9 for detailed integration guide.

**Quick integration:**
```r
# Load your data
my_data <- read.csv("your_msms_data.csv")

# Extract features and labels
feature_cols <- grep("^mz_", colnames(my_data), value = TRUE)
features <- as.matrix(my_data[, feature_cols])
labels <- factor(my_data$Class)

# Continue with script from Section 2 (Preprocessing)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Low accuracy (<70%)
- Check if classes are actually separable (biological question)
- Ensure sufficient samples (minimum 20 per class recommended)
- Try different preprocessing methods

**Problem:** Error "Singular matrix"
- Features are too highly correlated
- Remove features with correlation >0.95

**Problem:** All VIP scores <1
- May need fewer components
- Check if preprocessing is appropriate
- Verify classes are actually different

See [README_FULL.md](README_FULL.md) Section 12 for complete troubleshooting guide.
